# Factors-Affecting-Typing-Speed-DOE-


Typing is a necessity in the creation of any worded document. A typist should have a good speed and a low error record. These are the factors that are considered when a person is hired for a typing job. Typing is used in various fields from typing books to code programs. But to have a good speed there are factors that will affect the typing speed. 

The experiment that we conducted is one such experiment, where the factors like different languages, types of keyboards and some sort of distraction were part of the experiment. There are other factors that influence the typing, but we consider these to be the main factors. The experiment was performed to maximize the typing speed. Two subjects were chosen and made to write a paragraph of different languages. This factor was also combined with the other factors mentioned above and a total of eight combinations were run for each subject. 

The results obtained from this experiment shows that only two out of the three factors are significant factors that contribute to final model. Also, the interaction between these two factors is a significant factor for the final model. 

The final model includes the terms type of passage, the distraction and the interaction between these two terms. The results obtained from the experiment are included in this report. These kinds of experiments are helpful for managers when hiring new employees according to the kind of typing job.
